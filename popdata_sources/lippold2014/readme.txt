The following groups were excluded from the HGDP data because they had poor provenance, are tiny samples, or are well-represented by better, larger samples:

* BantuKenya
* BantuSouthAfrica
* Nilote
* San

Individuals with known relatives were screened out following the Rosenberg (2006) H952 panel identifiers.

The resulting list of kept samples is in the HGDP_info.csv file and these are the sequences in the hgdp_africa.fasta file.
